# Musheff API - A Mushroom Classification REST API

**Identify edible and poisonous Russian mushrooms with AI-powered precision**

This project provides a production-ready REST API for classifying 12 common Russian mushroom species using computer vision. Built around the `musheff` fine-tuned EfficientNet-B3 model, it delivers vital safety insights by distinguishing between edible and poisonous varieties - potentially preventing dangerous misidentifications during foraging.

## Key Features

üçÑ **Safety-first classification** - Critical edible/poisonous differentiation  
üß† **State-of-the-art model** - Fine-tuned `EfficientNet-B3` architecture  
üå≤ **Regional specialization** - Optimized for 12 common Russian species  
‚ö°Ô∏è **Production-ready** - Scalable REST API implementation  
üîç **Transparent foundations** - Built on openly available datasets

## Technical Foundation

Powered by:

- Model: **[musheff](https://huggingface.co/blasisd/musheff)** (Custom fine-tuned EfficientNet-B3)
- Dataset: **[12_popular_russia_mushrooms_edible_poisonous](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SoFa325/12_popular_russia_mushrooms_edible_poisonous)**

## Getting Started

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes. For details on deploying the project to a production environment, refer to the Deployment section.

### Prerequisites

To set up and run this project, ensure the following software and tools are installed on your system:

- **Python**: Version `3.10.12` or higher is required. Verify your Python version by running:

  ```bash
  python3 --version
  ```

- **Dependencies**: Install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt using pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- **Docker (Optional)**: For containerized deployment. Install from [Docker's official site](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and verify with:

  ```bash
  docker --version
  ```

### Local Development and Testing

To run the application locally for development and testing purposes, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7860 --reload
```

If it does not work, just try:

```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7860 --reload
```

> [!WARNING]
> Ensure you are in the project's **src** directory before running the script or adapt running path (i.e. `python -m uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7860 --reload`).

## How to Use

The API exposes a classification endpoint at `/classify` that accepts mushroom images and returns:

- Predicted mushroom species
- Edibility status (edible/poisonous)
- Confidence score

### API Endpoint

`POST /classify`

### Request Format

```bash
curl -X POST "http://<your-api-url>/classify" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "image_file=@path/to/mushroom.jpg"
```

### Example Response

```bash
{
    "mushroom_type": "Pleurotus_ostreatus",
    "toxicity_profile": "edible",
    "confidence": 0.5491
}
```

## Deployment

### Deployment on Hugging Face Spaces

To deploy the project on Hugging Face Spaces, follow these steps:

1. Create an account on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) if you don‚Äôt already have one.

2. Refer to the official [Spaces Overview](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces-overview) documentation for detailed instructions on setting up and deploying your project.

### Docker-based Deployment

#### Locally

- Build your docker image:

  ```bash
  docker build -t musheff-api .
  ```

- Run a container based on the image:

  ```bash
  docker run -it -p 7860:7860 musheff-api
  ```

#### On Hugging Face

1. Follow the official [Docker Spaces Guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces-sdks-docker-first-demo) for container setup.
2. Copy the available `Dockerfile` to your repository root or create your own.
3. Configure settings requirements in `README.md` metadata (especially app_port if you need a different port to use):

```yaml
